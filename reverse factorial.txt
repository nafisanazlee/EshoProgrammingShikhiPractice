A program to do the reverse factorial of an interger
First,It will ask to type an integer to do its reverse factorial.
(if it has an integer one)
Then to do the reverse factorial,it will follow some steps.
It'll start by dividing the number by 1.then by 2,then by 3,by 4 and so on until the result is "1".Basically it will divide the input by the positive integers serially.We'll do this using a for loop.
and the last divisor which gives the result 1 is the reverse factotial.
if the result becomes less than 1,it will show that the input doesn't have an integer "reverse factorial."
